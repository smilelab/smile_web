**SMILE** is affiliated with the [School of computer science and Engineering](http://www.ccse.uestc.edu.cn/) and [Big Data Research Center](http://www.bigdata-research.org/), [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](http://www.uestc.edu.cn/). It locates at the main building in the qingshuihe campus, mainly in B1-201. THe founding director of SMILE is Professor Xu Zenglin.

"SMILE" means "Statistical Machine Intelligence LEarning".

The main research interests of laboratory based on machine learning technology and its application. Our  research mainly  involves: Semi supervised learning, kernel learning, Bias learning, feature selection and extraction, multi task learning, multi view learning, active learning, online learning, matrix analysis, tensor analysis, deep learning, optimization algorithm, scalable learning, etc. The main application fields involve Internet, recommendation system, social network analysis, bioinformatics, neural Informatics, health data analysis, spatial safety data analysis, etc..
